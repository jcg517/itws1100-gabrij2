For this lab I tried a lot of new things with css and javascript so my site may be a little bit janky. Overall the its a good starting point. I need to populate the site with more content, especially the profile and projects section. I also plan to add animations to make it feel more smooth. When I have more projects to add to my portfolio, I would want to make that section better maybe with some horizontal scrolling and animations.

I used these sites for inspiration for the layout of my site.

I also used some styles and colors from the react documention website.

I also used chatGPT for some css help, mainly with flexbox and alignments.

Also my project html folder is in the lab3 folder and uses a different css file (because of the landing page javascript) whereas my index.html is in the root, which might cause some confusion for the submission and understanding the link structure.
