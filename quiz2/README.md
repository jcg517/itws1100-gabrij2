My code for questions 1.a and 1.b is in the quiz2.js file. It is intended to be ran via opening quiz2.html with a Live Server. If that is done, you will see the title of a randomly selected song in the json display as the header. If you refresh the page, you can see that the songs titles are being randomly selected.
