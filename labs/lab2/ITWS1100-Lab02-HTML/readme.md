I notice that writing your resume in HTML really makes you think about the structure of the document and what text is emphasized. This could be beneficial in making the resume more uniform and better able to be read by an employer's systems.

I'm not sure how my resume page handles on other browsers, devices or how it holds up to every kind of page resizing.

Some items on the resume may not be entirely accurate...
