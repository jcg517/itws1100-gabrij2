I think this lab was useful for me to see how to make a webpage reactive using vanilla javascript instead of a modern framework. Completing labs like this can help with understanding these technologies on a deeper level. I think the usability crimes is a useful exercise because it teaches us the proper UI principles from the beginning. I think this lab will make me look at websites, (even basic forms like this one), more thoughtfully and I will consider the javascript that runs them.
