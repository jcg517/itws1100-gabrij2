I thought this lab was really cool. It makes you see how everything is put together. The provided javascript and css code is the frontend of the web-application, and the php files are what bridge the data living in our MariaDB database on our Azure servers to the frontend content. 

I think that learning PHP this way, while it may not be the most sexy language, really helps you see what you are doing, and it makes sense based on the structure of the application.
